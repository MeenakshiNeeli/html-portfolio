<h3>Omen</h3>
<p>The Omen is one of the best horror films to have come out in the 70's. It isn't gory, it doesn't have sex, it is just plain terrifying. Everything about the movie contributes to feel of the movie. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score, the great acting, the cinematography and the scary as hell ending.</p>
<h3>Escape room</h3>
<p>This horror film/thriller has its virtues, but it badly strains viewers' suspension of disbelief and can't avoid feeling like Saw with duller teeth. The most fun parts of Escape Room are the occasional solvable puzzle and the detail and imagination in the sets.</p>
<h3>Room</h3>
<p>The intended theme was love and betrayal, and how two people, motivated by lust, excitement, and boredom, can bring themselves to destroy the life of the purported greatest guy in the world.</p>
